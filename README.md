# Introduction
Fluidity is a game resource storage and transport API for the Fabric toolchain. 

## Purpose
Provide a consistent and comprehensive API for storage and transport of any quantifiable and uniquely identifiable in-game resource, with excellent performance and flexiblity of scale and usage.

## Features
* Resource-type registry with pre-registered types for Items and Fluids
* Unified interfaces for all types of resources
* High-resolution, large-scale fraction implementation for lossless accounting of fluids and other resources that are continuous instead of discrete, or which have sub-unit quantization
* Registry for discovery and access to specific storage/transport implementations
* Transactions with support for heterogeneous resource types, nesting and concurrency (with limitations)
* Many base classes and helpers to support implementations
